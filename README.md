# SinchVideo

Simple 1-to-1 video conferencing web app using Sinch.

#Choice of tool

I chose this after going over and reviewing certain different tools like Agora, AWS Chime, Azure Communication Srvices and other 3rd party srvices, reason was ease of use, no-cost service provision and good documentation.

#Design

Currently a very simple design including basic HTML, CSS(bootsrap) at the index page and using Sinch APIs from client side JS file.
 
#Live Prototype
